# Code Clone Detection #

[Code Clone Detection](http://bit.ly/EDC-CodeCloneDetection) is a feature of Visual Studio, but is only available in the Ultimate or Premium levels.  You can find all clones in a solution, or find clones of a specific fragement.

In addition to discovering direct copies, the clone analysis tool can find fragments which differ in the names of variables and parameters, and in which some statements have been rearranged.
